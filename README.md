# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).
## Algorithm:
Identifying and Writing Problem Statements Identify user pain points. Write 1â€“2 clear UX problem statements using a defined template: "[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

Identifying Appropriate Research Methods Identify the most suitable research methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing, diary studies). Justify your method choice.

Creating Personas Based on previous user data or a given user scenario. Create at least two user personas with: Demographics Goals Behaviors Pain points Motivation
## Output:
This project focuses on creating an online store that sells environmentally and ethically sourced products, with a core feature being a highly transparent display of the supply chain and sustainability impact.

Identifying and Writing Problem Statements
User Pain Points:

Users are skeptical of sustainability claims (i.e., greenwashing) and don't trust generic badges.

They struggle to compare the actual ethical and environmental impact of products across different brands.

The process of finding detailed supply chain information is often fragmented or non-existent, requiring manual, external research.

Problem Statements:

"Conscious consumers need a way to easily verify the true environmental and ethical impact of a product because current e-commerce sites provide vague or untrustworthy claims, which results in purchase anxiety and a lack of confidence in making genuinely sustainable choices."

"Shoppers need a way to access comprehensive, verifiable supply chain data because the information is currently fragmented and difficult to find, which results in wasted time and the inability to compare products on a granular sustainability level."

Identifying Appropriate Research Methods
Selected Methods:

Competitive Analysis: To review how existing ethical e-commerce sites and major retailers currently handle and display sustainability claims.

Interviews: To talk to conscious consumers about their purchase anxieties, what transparency means to them, and what specific data points they look for (e.g., carbon footprint, fair wages).

Surveys: To broadly quantify the level of skepticism toward sustainability claims and prioritize which ethical/environmental factors are most important to the majority of the target audience.

Justification:

Competitive Analysis establishes a baseline of existing solutions and identifies best practices and common pitfalls regarding transparency.

Interviews are crucial for uncovering the deep-seated trust issues surrounding "greenwashing" and understanding the specific content users need to feel confident.

Surveys help ensure the design focuses on the most impactful data, preventing the team from building overly complex features that only a niche group would use.
